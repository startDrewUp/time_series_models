# Financial Time Series Models

This repository contains implementations of classical time series models focused on financial data, built entirely from scratch.

## 📈 Models Included
- **AR (AutoRegressive) models**
- **MA (Moving Average) models**
- **ARCH (Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) models**
- **GARCH (Generalized ARCH) models**
- **Multivariate GARCH models** (e.g., DCC-GARCH)

## 🛠️ Purpose
- Build deep understanding by implementing models from the ground up.
- Practice applying these models on real financial data.
- Create a reusable mini-library for time series modeling.

## 📚 Project Structure
- `/data/`: Raw and processed data
- `/utils/`: Helper functions (data loading, plotting)
- `/AR_models/`, `/MA_models/`, etc.: Model-specific code
- `/notebooks/`: Prototyping and experiments
